# Athena Mesh Body Script

The Athena5 HUD has one linked prim for every alpha. This makes the prim usage very high, while setting it up is a lot easier than having one-face -> one alpha.

It is using an older version of the script where link numbers can be set by number and not via base64 strings. This might sound like it would be easier to set up, but it really isn't and its very body specific and makes the script hard to adjust for other bodies.
Also this old script version does definitelly not support multiple layers.

This is just here as a reference for the future.
